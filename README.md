# SpaceTime Clock

This is a SvelteKit app that displays the current date and time in a unique way.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the repository and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
